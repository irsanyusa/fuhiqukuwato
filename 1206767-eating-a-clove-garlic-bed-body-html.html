About 100 biologically active components are found in the structure of garlic, and not all of them are thoroughly studied. However, the following features of garlic that help to improve metabolism and lose weight have already been recorded and proven:</p><ul><li>Garlic normalizes blood sugar levels, the jumps of which cause bouts of hunger and activate hormones. It gives the command to preserve storage of fat.</li><li>Garlic helps to establish healthy blood flow and lymphatic drainage. The fluid does not linger and does not create extra pounds.</li><li>Garlic promotes healthy metabolism in the body fighting “bad” cholesterol and helping to absorb “good.”</li><li>Due to its antifungal effect, garlic effectively fights against Candida fungi, infection of which is one of the hidden causes of weight gain and diabetes.</li><li>Those who suffer from excess weight have impaired adrenaline production. This hormone is responsible for accelerating the breakdown of fats and loss of appetite. Regular use of garlic allows you to restore this process and at the same time suppress the production of the hormone cortisol, which destroys muscle proteins and causes a painful craving for salty and sweet.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2erjut5r0cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top reasons to drink Zobo</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/da5cefb9a0152ede.jpg><p class=align-left>The easiest way to experience the slimming effect of garlic is to add fresh cloves to regular food. However, if you wish (and there are no medical contraindications), you can use the following recipes for weight loss with garlic:</p><ul><li><strong>Garlic and water.</strong> Crush two cloves of garlic, mix with 200 ml of pure non-carbonated water of room temperature and drink it immediately. It is recommended to consume such a drink after the morning awakening and before bedtime.</li><li><strong>Garlic and apple vinegar.</strong> You should consume 2-3 freshly minced cloves of garlic in a mixture with 2 cups and a half of apple cider vinegar. Do it every day in 30 minutes before lunch.</li><li><strong>Garlic in olive oil.</strong> This recipe refers to traditional Spanish dishes. The garlic-olive mixture can be eaten alone or be added to meals. Olive oil plays the role of a preserving agent. So healthy substances of crushed garlic last longer. But it makes sense to cook a fresh mixture at least once a week. Its recipe is very easy: squeeze 50 grams of garlic into a bowl with a ground lid, and mix with 100 ml of cold pressing olive oil, then add spices (red pepper, rosemary).</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4ed5arh9mk4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why should we include guava in our diet?

However, doctors warn: do not eat a lot of garlic if you suffer from diseases of the capillaries, bleeding disorders, and chronic plethora syndrome. Increased use of garlic can cause blood thinning. Therefore, the popular recipe for treatment, for example, bleeding gums with garlic is ambiguous and requires a professional doctor's assessment. If the red marks on the toothbrush are associated with a lack of vitamin C, regular chewing of fragrant cloves can be an excellent firming agent, but if the gums bleed another reason, garlic can hurt.</p><p class=align-left>Women should not eat a lot of garlic during pregnancy. Also, if you have unpleasant problems with intestinal function, then do not eat garlic too. It can easily irritate any mucous membranes of the internal organs. But even if you cannot consume garlic in its fresh form, you can find alternatives. In order not to get sick, you can spread the garlic in the apartment or carry a slice with you or you can purchase special garlic capsules in the drugstore.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5mp3ekm0a8r.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 benefits of ginger and garlic that you should know about</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, garlic is contraindicated to people who suffer from diseases of the kidneys. It is recommended to use it with caution in gastritis and ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract. And do not forget that garlic contributes to the accumulation of gases in the intestines. Do not abuse this useful plant, if you know the tendency to meteorism in your body. Besides, the composition of garlic can provoke the appearance of a specific unpleasant odour not only of respiration but also of the whole body. Extractive aromatic substances come out with sweat.
