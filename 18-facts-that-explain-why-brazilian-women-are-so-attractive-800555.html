It’s not for nothing that this opinion exists&nbsp;— every female resident of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Brazil data-link=tag>Brazil</a> feels proud of&nbsp;her body and allows herself some good rest on&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular basis. But that’s just the tip of&nbsp;the iceberg.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>outlined some curious details about the lives and behaviors of&nbsp;Brazilian women. And it’s thanks to&nbsp;these things that they look and feel super attractive.</p><p><h2>1. Braces are a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;wealth.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9fa/34d/6636235231a4c5cfffbac1466d.jpg><p>Brazilians are an&nbsp;extremely smiley nationality, that’s why beautiful and even teeth are a&nbsp;must for them. <strong>Both young and old people wear <a href=#>braces</a></strong> here. A&nbsp;person gets braces once they save enough money, and it&nbsp;doesn’t matter how old this person is&nbsp;at&nbsp;the moment. Moreover, all women have a&nbsp;special attitude toward the whiteness of&nbsp;their teeth&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;norm for them to&nbsp;<a href=#>brush their teeth</a> in&nbsp;the mall after having a&nbsp;meal.</p><p>“Brazilians wear their braces with pride and love, and smile even wider with them than without them. All because, if&nbsp;you wear braces, it&nbsp;means you are a&nbsp;wealthy person. When I&nbsp;came to&nbsp;this country for the first time, I&nbsp;had braces too. In&nbsp;fact, every other person has braces in&nbsp;Brazil and they even took me&nbsp;for a&nbsp;local. After this trip, I&nbsp;stopped feeling shy about having them and started to&nbsp;smile confidently, not trying to&nbsp;hide the metal in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mouth. However, my&nbsp;braces were at&nbsp;least 1.5 times cheaper than Brazilian ones,” said a&nbsp;blogger who <a href=#>shared</a> her observations on&nbsp;this topic.</p><p>“I’ve been brushing my&nbsp;teeth with coconut oil since&nbsp;I was 9. I&nbsp;started doing it&nbsp;accidentally when my&nbsp;mother’s boyfriend bought me&nbsp;this oil as&nbsp;a&nbsp;present. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;eat it&nbsp;and&nbsp;I liked&nbsp;it, then <strong>for some reason&nbsp;I started to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;my&nbsp;toothbrush</strong>. Recently I&nbsp;met a&nbsp;Brazilian woman and she told me&nbsp;that this oil kills bacteria and whitens teeth. I&nbsp;would never have believed her otherwise, but&nbsp;I haven’t had a&nbsp;single cavity in&nbsp;my&nbsp;teeth within the last 30&nbsp;years,” said one foreigner who <a href=#>shared</a> her life hack with the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/826/d25/bfc1415af5b6b6d8239ce8c772.jpg><p><h2>2. A&nbsp;curvy body shape is&nbsp;trendy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b9/9ee/9474295ca1a2ef54fa1187bb5a.jpg><p>Tourists who come here for Carnival get the wrong opinion that all local beauties are slim. In&nbsp;fact, <strong>many women <a href=#>are prone</a> to&nbsp;curviness</strong>. In&nbsp;Brazil, <a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a> change with the tides: blonde and thin one moment and curvy and dark-haired the next. Regardless of&nbsp;their body type, girls opt for short shorts and short tight tops, though it’s not a&nbsp;rule. Brazilian women are taught from childhood to&nbsp;love their body, whatever shape it&nbsp;has, and constant attention from men supports the beautiful half of&nbsp;the planet in&nbsp;the belief that each of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;a&nbsp;goddess, although, once again, this isn’t a&nbsp;rule.</p><p><h2>3. Brazilian women don’t accept the answer “No” without an&nbsp;explanation and won’t say “No” to&nbsp;others without explaining the reason.</h2></p><p>Any refusal should come along with an&nbsp;explanation of&nbsp;the reason&nbsp;— according to&nbsp;the <a href=#>etiquette</a> of&nbsp;this country. If&nbsp;the reason is&nbsp;not there, you’ll have to&nbsp;make one up&nbsp;so&nbsp;you don’t offend someone. They in&nbsp;their turn often <a href=#>act</a> as&nbsp;follows: they accept the offer with a&nbsp;smile, promise many nice things, and <strong>later don’t keep their promise</strong>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more respectful here than to&nbsp;simply say “no.”</p><p><h2>4. Women never miss their manicure or&nbsp;pedicure session.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec8/3c5/7f9f2653da846686b2d8df5a7e.jpg><p>Brazilian women might not wear any makeup or&nbsp;jewelry but the beauty of&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>nails</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;cult here</strong>. It&nbsp;doesn’t matter whether you invite the nail tech to&nbsp;your home or&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;salon&nbsp;— there are many nail technicians there who serve the same <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> for many years. The price doesn’t stop Brazilian women from making their nails beautiful, even if&nbsp;the family budget is&nbsp;limited.</p><p>However, their <a href=# title=manicure data-link=tag>manicure</a> <a href=#>techniques</a> impress foreigners: <strong>nail techs apply nail polish on&nbsp;nails and the skin around them and then remove the excess polish with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Q-tip and nail polish remover</strong>. They do&nbsp;both the manicure and <a href=# title=pedicure data-link=tag>pedicure</a> pretty fast&nbsp;— in&nbsp;about 30&nbsp;minutes: they apply the cream on&nbsp;the cuticles, cut the nails, and apply the nail polish. Each technician has a&nbsp;special powder. If&nbsp;the skin is&nbsp;hurt, the master puts powder on&nbsp;the affected area. Wealthy Brazilians find it&nbsp;inappropriate to&nbsp;have patterns or&nbsp;pictures, nail art, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;paint nails in&nbsp;different colors. That’s why this type of&nbsp;service is&nbsp;absent from elite salons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b8/d9e/71285a5f3ab9d7972ae3c5fc83.jpg><p><h2>5. You can often see girls wearing winter boots and leather jackets when it’s 85°F outside.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/047/45c/d30642559baace238772a2b5de.jpg><p>First of&nbsp;all, local people want to&nbsp;<a href=#>diversify</a> their wardrobe, wear trendy clothes, and not limit their choice of&nbsp;outfits to&nbsp;summer dresses, skirts, and summer shoes only. Second, they really feel cold.</p><p>Here is&nbsp;what a&nbsp;girl who moved to&nbsp;Brazil <a href=#>noticed</a>, “Today in&nbsp;the morning a&nbsp;neighbor tells&nbsp;me, “<strong>It’s so&nbsp;cold out there! The rain and the wind are icy! It’s terrible!</strong>” She was wearing a&nbsp;jacket, winter boots, and a&nbsp;warm scarf. When I&nbsp;went outside, I&nbsp;found out that the <a href=# title=weather data-link=tag>weather</a> was nice, a&nbsp;little bit chilly, and it&nbsp;was drizzling. Yep, that’s not hot. I&nbsp;was wearing a&nbsp;long sleeve, sweatpants, and trainers. The thermometer was showing 65°F in&nbsp;the morning and 70°F in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the day.</p><p>In&nbsp;any case, women <strong><a href=#>opt for</a> bright colors</strong> and massive prints&nbsp;— the “leopard” print on&nbsp;clothes is&nbsp;extremely widespread here. They prefer synthetic and jersey clothes for practical reasons.</p><p><h2>6. Women rarely wear jewelry.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/272/c41/fb265e5d74b50dbdaac0a38cda.jpg><p>Most often, they prefer bijou. Due to&nbsp;the high crime rate in&nbsp;the country, <strong>women <a href=#>wear</a> jewelry only on&nbsp;special occasions</strong> and only in&nbsp;places where they will feel safe. The first recommendation for tourists who are going to&nbsp;visit Rio or&nbsp;São Paulo is&nbsp;to&nbsp;not “show off” their gadgets, remove all the jewelry from their bodies, and wear their backpacks on&nbsp;the front when taking public transport. It&nbsp;decreases the risk of&nbsp;getting into trouble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/622/5b3/ea42f05a45a1891eb41c86e1ab.jpg><p><h2>7. Many people take a&nbsp;shower several times a&nbsp;day.</h2></p><p>An&nbsp;easy way for families to&nbsp;have hot water on&nbsp;hand in&nbsp;the household are <a href=#>electric showers</a>. At&nbsp;the same time, taking a&nbsp;cool shower when it’s 100°F outside is&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice thing. All in&nbsp;all, this habit is&nbsp;logical&nbsp;— many people sweat heavily due to&nbsp;the heat and they don’t want to&nbsp;move around with a&nbsp;sticky body all day. By&nbsp;the way, <strong>bathtubs are a&nbsp;luxury for Brazilians</strong>. If&nbsp;someone lives in&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment with a&nbsp;tiny bathtub instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;shower cabin, then it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;VIP apartment. Many Brazilians are also in&nbsp;the habit of&nbsp;bathing <a href=#>multiple times a&nbsp;day</a>, thanks in&nbsp;part to&nbsp;the country’s <a href=#>hot, humid climate</a>.</p><p><h2>8. They are emotionally open.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a3/271/0df21954e09bfc4af1529c87c6.jpg><p>It’s considered <a href=#>normal</a> to&nbsp;hug and kiss people on&nbsp;both cheeks when greeting and saying goodbye to&nbsp;them. At&nbsp;the same time, it&nbsp;doesn’t really matter whether it&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;old friend or&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who you are meeting for the first time. When hugging you a&nbsp;Brazilian woman will say the word “Prazer,” which <a href=#>means</a> “Nice to&nbsp;meet you.”</p><p>Brazilians <a href=#>believe</a> that <strong>the closer they are to&nbsp;people, the better</strong>. Even if&nbsp;there are only a&nbsp;few people on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bus, they will sit next to&nbsp;another passenger. Someone will always start a&nbsp;conversation while standing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;line, while an&nbsp;unknown woman in&nbsp;an&nbsp;elevator might easily compliment you, “What a&nbsp;nice scarf you are wearing!” and subsequently ask where you bought&nbsp;it. It’s the norm for them, but it’s something that foreigners find difficult to&nbsp;understand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b7/63e/4d7cb853c2a9789ec9978c3292.jpg><p><h2>9. Many women dream of&nbsp;having flat hair.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38c/951/52b5a850d795ce38e5035673dd.jpg><p>Due to&nbsp;the influence of&nbsp;European culture, many Brazilian women with curly hair by&nbsp;nature like to&nbsp;<a href=#>straighten</a> it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;hair straightener or&nbsp;with other different methods. This habit seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;slowly dying, though.</p><p><h2>10. They take the initiative in&nbsp;relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd2/ce4/aaacde5402b59b268cf657879d.jpg><p>Local girls are not used to&nbsp;getting married early, but relationships in&nbsp;this country start very fast.&nbsp;2&nbsp;people quickly move from the stage of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>flirting</a> to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;couple officially. But, they don’t rush into official <a href=# title=marriages data-link=tag>marriages</a> here. <strong>The average </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>age</strong></a><strong> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bride is&nbsp;30</strong>. The main reasons for late marriages include the wish to&nbsp;build up&nbsp;a&nbsp;career, to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;home, and to&nbsp;live for one’s own pleasure before settling down.</p><p>"Relatives and friends don’t ask about when they are going to&nbsp;have grandkids at&nbsp;all. You won’t hear phrases like, “You need to&nbsp;have kids! It’s time! You are almost 25&nbsp;and you have no&nbsp;kids!” On&nbsp;the contrary, they usually say “You are only&nbsp;25, you are young and have plenty of&nbsp;time. Build your life and enjoy being with your spouse. You’ll have children later,” that’s the cultural difference one girl who moved to&nbsp;Brazil <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>noticed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/172/90c/16db775fdc924ff9d92d952f10.jpg><p><h2>11. Many families have babysitters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bcb/185/75e86b579299a064c9a28653bb.jpg><p>Some Brazilian women start choosing a&nbsp;babysitter as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;they find out they are pregnant. Maternity leave is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>120-180&nbsp;days</a>, women have to&nbsp;work, and babysitting services are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>inexpensive</a>. That’s why there are many babysitters here. Moreover, for this money, not only <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>will</a> they look after the children, but they will also cook and clean the house.</p><p><h2>12. At&nbsp;the same time, mothers can take their babies wherever they want.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c5/b83/8c5fe75fefb8b8aa7fd5467ef1.jpg><p>A&nbsp;young mother might easily take her small baby to&nbsp;a&nbsp;noisy party late in&nbsp;the evening or&nbsp;to&nbsp;watch a&nbsp;soccer match. Tourists might <a href=#>get</a> culturally shocked if&nbsp;they visit a&nbsp;cinema in&nbsp;Brazil because<strong> they might find kids crawling in&nbsp;the aisles</strong>, while their mothers will be&nbsp;watching the movie.</p><p>This <a href=#>story</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright example, “My&nbsp;husband’s relatives invited&nbsp;us to&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid’s birthday. I&nbsp;was surprised by&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the celebration&nbsp;— it&nbsp;wasn’t starting until 8&nbsp;PM. My&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;already in&nbsp;bed by&nbsp;this time, but we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;shift her sleep a&nbsp;bit and drop by&nbsp;to&nbsp;the party for an&nbsp;hour. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;went there, spent some time there, and started to&nbsp;say goodbye to&nbsp;everyone. The granddad of&nbsp;the birthday girl stopped&nbsp;us and started to&nbsp;stress about why we&nbsp;were leaving so&nbsp;early, and why we&nbsp;didn’t wait until the candle blowing ceremony. When we&nbsp;explained the reason for our early leaving, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;laugh and said sarcastically, <strong>‘Your home rules are like being in&nbsp;the army.’</strong> Needless to&nbsp;say, the Brazilian kids were having fun all night and no&nbsp;one, apart from&nbsp;us, was bothered by&nbsp;the fact that kids were supposed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;sleep earlier.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdd/da6/558e33569d8643930e134665cd.jpg><p><h2>13. Time goes by&nbsp;differently for Brazilians.</h2></p><p>It’s important to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>keep in&nbsp;mind</a> that no&nbsp;one hurries anywhere in&nbsp;Brazil. You can relax and enjoy the moment here and take a&nbsp;rest from the quick rhythm of&nbsp;western countries. It’s impossible to&nbsp;make Brazilians do&nbsp;anything fast. They will be&nbsp;nodding and apologizing, but will keep doing whatever they were doing at&nbsp;their own pace. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Time</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;abstract term for them. Their mantra seems to&nbsp;be: “If&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;today, <strong>we&nbsp;will do&nbsp;it&nbsp;eventually.”</strong></p><p>There are numerous <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>legends</a> about the lateness of&nbsp;local people, “I&nbsp;live in&nbsp;Brazil. People are quite relaxed here, they don’t worry about the little things and they never hurry. That’s why they have issues with punctuality. Once, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;conversation with a&nbsp;friend. She works in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bank and believes she is&nbsp;very organized. The bank opens at&nbsp;9&nbsp;AM. <strong>She is&nbsp;no&nbsp;more than 30&nbsp;minutes late.</strong> After she arrives, she needs to&nbsp;change clothes, have breakfast, and drink a&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;coffee. But since all Brazilians know and understand this, clients won’t start coming in&nbsp;before 10&nbsp;AM. She believes it’s inhumane that people in&nbsp;other countries might arrive at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain place earlier than 9&nbsp;AM if&nbsp;this organization doesn’t start to&nbsp;work until 9&nbsp;AM.”</p><p><h2>14. A&nbsp;girl’s 15th birthday is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big event.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4d/2ce/1c23ed51f989e358cb17b42539.jpg><p>It’s not 18&nbsp;or 21, but the 15th birthday that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big deal here. Boys don’t have this significant date. This event is&nbsp;oftentimes celebrated more pompously than a&nbsp;wedding. The <a href=#>tradition</a> comes from ancient times&nbsp;— back then a&nbsp;girl was ready to&nbsp;get married at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15&nbsp;and the purpose of&nbsp;these parties was <strong>to&nbsp;show the girl to&nbsp;potential grooms</strong> and their families. The current scale of&nbsp;the celebration depends on&nbsp;the financial condition of&nbsp;the family. Usually, many guests are invited, special decorations are ordered, and a&nbsp;big restaurant is&nbsp;rented. If&nbsp;the family lives in&nbsp;a&nbsp;private house, they hire cooks, waiters, and a&nbsp;host. The birthday girl has a&nbsp;gorgeous dress, huge cakes, and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;other stuff.</p><p><h2>15. There are no&nbsp;boundaries or&nbsp;personal borders in&nbsp;conversations.</h2></p><p>Colleagues might easily <a href=#>say</a> to&nbsp;you that your new hairstyle doesn’t suit you and that your new dress makes you look fat. If&nbsp;you buy a&nbsp;new car, they might say that the color and the brand are actually so-so. It’s not just the people who are close to&nbsp;you that can say this, <strong>this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal manner of&nbsp;<a href=# title=communicating data-link=tag>communicating</a> between slightly familiar people who don’t have a&nbsp;close relationship</strong>. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;taken for rudeness and impoliteness, but the thing is&nbsp;that Brazilians don’t get offended by&nbsp;the remarks of&nbsp;other people. It’s the norm for them.</p><p>One girl shared her <a href=#>experience</a>, “They will raise the topic of&nbsp;health even with a&nbsp;relatively unfamiliar person. A&nbsp;person may easily tell you that he&nbsp;has just recently left the hospital where he&nbsp;was being treated for hemorrhoids, while Maria has problems with urination and it&nbsp;hurts when she uses the toilet. How many times a&nbsp;day do&nbsp;you pee? Woah, you’ve gained weight, are you pregnant by&nbsp;chance? I&nbsp;heard many of&nbsp;these things from either my&nbsp;former colleagues or&nbsp;the occasional people&nbsp;I talked to&nbsp;on&nbsp;the bus. I&nbsp;have even heard questions from clients with whom&nbsp;I shared a&nbsp;little small talk while accepting their order. I&nbsp;still can’t understand: Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;a&nbsp;cultural thing and a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;openness or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;impoliteness and the breaking of&nbsp;personal borders? I&nbsp;am more prone to&nbsp;think it’s the first option.”</p><p><h2>16. Women are very hot-tempered but they cool down fast as&nbsp;well.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22a/f21/04592f5ff98e7ae52f0332a25e.jpg><p>Having a&nbsp;relationship with a&nbsp;local girl is&nbsp;like experiencing a&nbsp;hurricane. She <a href=#>can</a> feel jealous of&nbsp;her boyfriend quite frequently and cause a&nbsp;scene, which in&nbsp;most cases is&nbsp;<strong>followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic and fast reconciliation</strong>. People don’t feel shy about expressing their feelings in&nbsp;public and they don’t get embarrassed about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>17. They live with their parents before marriage.</h2></p><p>They don’t find it&nbsp;sensible to&nbsp;spend money on&nbsp;rent. It’s convenient for them to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>live with</a> their parents, not only from a&nbsp;financial perspective but also from an&nbsp;everyday life perspective: the food is&nbsp;always ready, the house is&nbsp;always clean. However, bills, in&nbsp;this case, are split in&nbsp;half, while<strong> the money that could be&nbsp;spent on&nbsp;renting another apartment is&nbsp;not spent but put aside and saved</strong>. In&nbsp;most cases, when a&nbsp;person finds their other half, they have money saved for an&nbsp;apartment or&nbsp;a&nbsp;house, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;their own car. It’s inappropriate to&nbsp;live with your parents after you get married in&nbsp;Brazil.</p><p><h2>18. Plastic surgery is&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their life.</h2></p><p>Brazil <a href=#>is</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;second place in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;people who have resorted to&nbsp;plastic surgery (and first in&nbsp;plastic surgery per capita). It&nbsp;seems that this is&nbsp;contrary to&nbsp;the concept of&nbsp;“love yourself as&nbsp;you are,” but in&nbsp;fact, it’s not. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that even if&nbsp;one loves their body, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that one doesn’t want to&nbsp;improve&nbsp;it. Various lifting procedures are the most common things here. Just don’t ask a&nbsp;woman about who she goes to&nbsp;unless she’s open about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Which things from the Brazilian <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a> looked cool to&nbsp;you and which ones do&nbsp;you find inappropriate?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated at June 2021 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH55ecWamq2rXam1osCMnq%2BppJGeu27Dx7Jkm6qRr7attcCnZLCnnZq7bq3RnmSsp12WwbW%2BwJyroq6VYoVxfJRubGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f18-facts-that-explain-why-brazilian-women-are-so-attractive-800555.html&text=18%20Facts%20That%20Explain%20Why%20Brazilian%20Women%20Are%20So%20Attractive&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f18-facts-that-explain-why-brazilian-women-are-so-attractive-800555.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f18-facts-that-explain-why-brazilian-women-are-so-attractive-800555.html&title=18%20Facts%20That%20Explain%20Why%20Brazilian%20Women%20Are%20So%20Attractive" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f18-facts-that-explain-why-brazilian-women-are-so-attractive-800555.html&title=18%20Facts%20That%20Explain%20Why%20Brazilian%20Women%20Are%20So%20Attractive" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f18-facts-that-explain-why-brazilian-women-are-so-attractive-800555.html&title=18%20Facts%20That%20Explain%20Why%20Brazilian%20Women%20Are%20So%20Attractive" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f18-facts-that-explain-why-brazilian-women-are-so-attractive-800555.html&description=18%20Facts%20That%20Explain%20Why%20Brazilian%20Women%20Are%20So%20Attractive" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./backstreet-boys-aj-mclean-wins-rupauls-secret-celebrity-drag-race.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Backstreet Boys' AJ McLean Wins 'RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./whoopi-goldberg-to-star-in-the-christmas-pearl-1201125311.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whoopi Goldberg to Star in The Christmas Pearl">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
