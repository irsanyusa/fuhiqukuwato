Or sitting side-by-side with a stranger, as if I’m in a bar or a confessional. Maybe it’s the anonymity of knowing that we are almost certainly never going to see each other again. But I’ve found that we’re more willing to share our stories when we travel next to strangers. Our stories are where we meet; they are the crossroads of human experience. Perhaps more importantly, we share our stories to know we’re not alone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This I’ve learned from traveling over 150,000 miles by Greyhound Bus across America for more than 15 years. It’s surely what led me to the bus in the first place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I was 16, I woke up one morning to find my father outside dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. I blamed myself, knowing I was with him the night before and feeling that I should have done something. For years, I pretended I had dealt with his suicide, but the truth is I couldn’t cry. Music became my crying, and I put most of the processing on lay away.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I was 32 when I set out on my first Greyhound trip in 2004. Inspired by Depression-era projects like those of <a href=# rel=noopener>Woody Guthrie</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>James Agee</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Dorothea Lange</a> that helped draw a fuller portrait of America, I bought an initial six-week bus pass, bringing along a Gibson guitar and a copy of Woody Guthrie’s Bound for Glory. I began writing songs about my fellow riders along the way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Juneteenth’s Vision of Freedom Expresses American Values Better Than the Fourth of July’s</a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Through each one-stop-light town, each blighted-on-one-side-gilded-on-the-other metropolis, through successive presidents and parties in power, I’ve seen an America that might sound like it contradicts much of the news, but doesn’t—it’s an America that is greater than the sum of its differences. It’s the beauty of a country passing by on the bus, like moving murals, and is matched by the resplendence and resilience of the Americans traveling aboard it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Greyhound’s bus routes serve roughly 10 times the number of destinations as the largest airline in America. This sweeping view of the country is part of reason I’ve continued traveling by bus, performing along the way in shelters, prisons, and VAs. For riders and drivers alike, there are truck stop smoke breaks, pre-dawn meal stops at Jack in the Box, transfers at 3 a.m. There is no other realm where retirees and runaways, ex-felons and vets, members of rival gangs all share a roughly 10-yard by 3-yard space for days on end in cases. There are pairings of humanity you’d never see anywhere else but this bus and this land at this time, sharing breaks by the roadside truck stops, or up and down the aisle at all hours. A rolling congregation of souls.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes, this is among the most fractious and frenetic periods in our country’s history. The political divisions are deep and significant, and yes, racial, economic, and class segregation exist institutionally and culturally. But at the same time, in so many of the places we spend time together, the differences inform the commonalities. Especially when we’re traveling, no one wants to get into a debate they can’t get out of. Instead, we seek points of connection.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is no halcyon view of the country. No other mass transporter of Americans has been more reflective of the challenges of our time: the deepening disparity that has rural and urban citizens alike staring up at the stark underside of an <a href=#>unforgiving economy</a>; the <a href=# rel=noopener>impacts</a> of two of America’s longest wars in history; the entwined epidemics of <a href=#>addiction</a> and <a href=#>mental illness</a>; <a href=#>mass incarceration</a> and recidivism; <a href=#>gun violence</a> and <a href=#>suicide</a>. It is a cross section of people for whom security has long been counted in days and weeks— not months and years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’ve seen a half-filled bus consoling a weeping woman on her way from Pennsylvania to California for the funeral of her brother who had been hit by a car. I’ve heard a soldier’s voice break as he spoke to another passenger along the aisle about failing his brother in arms in Afghanistan, spurring others to talk about their own self-blame. I’ve become dear friends with a man I met on the bus who discovered his son shot in the head by an errant bullet. “Why were we in that neighborhood?” he asked me. “I should have protected my son better.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These riders forced me to realize that the reasons we set out to do something and the reasons we turn out to have done it are not always the same. The passage of time is the only light by which to know the difference. My story, including how I ended up on a Greyhound, was inextricably tied to theirs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Closure is sometimes a group act, and trauma, as I’ve seen on the bus, is a universal binding force, a common denominator, propelling us to our life’s work. It’s the source material, the kindling for a fire around which we all sit at night. And this I learned from absolute strangers of disparate backgrounds on countless Greyhound buses when I was seeking nothing of the sort. Ultimately, I’ve found, we learn from one another how to forgive ourselves.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s something inherently American about these interactions, where aspects of identity that shape our stories give rise, in certain settings, to something more collective. Perhaps we’re a confessional, mobile culture. But the country I’ve seen is not the one of online spats and stats. In a season of unending discourse about our divides, in our politics and communities, my Greyhound journeys have served as a tonic, a counterpoint rooted in our common places, one that is not naive about the cleaving forces, but sees a broader, connected human story. A story in which we are all just travelers on a bus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlmhnl9jp2poq6Zo7RurcKrpqyrXarAbrPRnrChp6WjsW6u1KxknqujlsZw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdriving-across-us-greyhound-bus-essay.html&text=The%20America%20I%20Saw%20by%20Traveling%20150%2c000%20Miles%20on%20Greyhound&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdriving-across-us-greyhound-bus-essay.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdriving-across-us-greyhound-bus-essay.html&title=The%20America%20I%20Saw%20by%20Traveling%20150%2c000%20Miles%20on%20Greyhound" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdriving-across-us-greyhound-bus-essay.html&title=The%20America%20I%20Saw%20by%20Traveling%20150%2c000%20Miles%20on%20Greyhound" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdriving-across-us-greyhound-bus-essay.html&title=The%20America%20I%20Saw%20by%20Traveling%20150%2c000%20Miles%20on%20Greyhound" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdriving-across-us-greyhound-bus-essay.html&description=The%20America%20I%20Saw%20by%20Traveling%20150%2c000%20Miles%20on%20Greyhound" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-batman-2-release-date-october-2025-1235506926.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Batman Part II Sets 2025 Release Date as Part of Newly Branded DC Elseworlds P">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pachinko-review-apple.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pachinko Is a Lovely Adaptation, Marred by 1 Baffling Choice">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
