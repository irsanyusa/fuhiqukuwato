Here, King’s story about her relationship with Alice Walker’s novel and its multiple adaptations.</p><p><i>The Color Purple </i>has been with me from the very beginning. I read the book because <a href=#>Oprah</a> had strongly recommended it. I can’t say it’s something I would’ve picked up, but she was just raving about it. And of course it delivered.</p><p>The first time I got to go on a set was when they were <a href=#>shooting the movie</a>. It was Oprah’s first movie, so I was just going as a looky-loo just to see what she was doing because I was so psyched that she had gotten a part. Not only a part, but a bona fide part. I was her friend and was just going to cheer her on. I was like, “Can I come?” We’d already been friends for at least 10 years, and we were clearly best friends, so that didn’t seem like an inappropriate ask. I was a news anchor in Hartford, Conn., at the time, and I took vacation days to go. I’d never been on a <a href=#>movie set</a> before, so I thought everything was cool: the craft table, lights, camera, action, all the costumes. And then to see her in her first acting job—that added to it.</p><p>I still am trying to figure out how I ended up in a costume in the wedding scene, because I certainly didn’t ask to do that. I would’ve never dreamed of asking. Either Oprah said something or a producer said, “Would your friend like to be in the movie?”</p><p>“Doing what?”</p><p>“All she has to do is just stand there.” I didn’t even know what I was agreeing to.</p><p>Look, if you blink, you will miss me. You actually have to go frame by frame to catch me. Put it in slow motion. But that was OK. I was excited to get a wardrobe and be told where to stand. And I realized that moviemaking is a very long, tedious process, because you do take after take after take after take. To say that I am in the movie is being generous. I’m just standing there. I did try to stand next to Oprah, so at least I wouldn’t get totally cut out.</p><p>I was not one of those people who said, “Let me stand in the back row.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/purple-rising-book.jpg><p>Twenty years later, when I was editor at large for Oprah’s magazine, I ended up at a table reading of the Broadway show. No props, no costumes. I was just going to make a pop-through to be polite because Scott [Sanders] had asked me, and I was going to leave halfway through. I didn’t know what we were going to see.</p><p>I couldn’t even understand how that movie could translate on a stage. Almost from the moment they began, though, I was so blown away. It was the power of the words and their voices. I said, “Oh, I need to see how this ends.” I called my office and said, “Call my lunch plans and say something has come up.”</p><p>What brought me to tears was the voices and the words to the songs. “Dear God – Shug,” “I’m Here,” “The Color Purple,” “Too Beautiful for Words.” I mean, I was mesmerized. And I called Oprah and said, “You should really pay attention to this. This is something very special.” I said to her, “I can’t even describe to you what I just saw and heard. But it literally made the hair stand up on the back of my neck.” She said, “I’ll come and see it.” And she felt what I felt. And the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>I saw the <a href=#>Broadway play</a> 17 times. Anytime somebody would come into town, I would say, “You’ve got to go see this.” LaChanze from the very beginning to <a href=#>Cynthia Erivo</a> and all of the permutations in between, I saw.</p><p>And now, with <a href=#>Blitz Bazawule’s</a> film, you have the third interpretation. It’s interesting that this one piece of work can have all these adaptations and forms, and all of them are still brilliant and still beautiful.</p><p>Am I in the new movie? No. Uh-huh. No one asked me to do anything, including Oprah. No one said, “Hey, would you like to be in it?” All they said when I visited the set was, “Hey, <a href=#>Gayle</a>.”</p><p>Copyright © 2023 by Scott Sanders Productions, Inc.
