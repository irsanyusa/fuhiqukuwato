Klek Entos</h3><p>This spooky magician <a href=#>previously competed on France’s Got Talent</a>. He freaked the judges out with his audition, which ended with a live tarantula. Klek Entos’ true identity is former France’s Got Talent magician David Stone. We wonder if he’ll ever reveal himself after making it to the live shows.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWJfhyJFcog</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-30-l-a-kyle>30.
