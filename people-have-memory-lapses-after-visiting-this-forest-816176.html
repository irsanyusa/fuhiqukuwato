In&nbsp;this city, you meet new people, and they tell you the story of&nbsp;the mysterious Hoia Baciu <a href=# title=forest data-link=tag>forest</a>, located to&nbsp;the west of&nbsp;the city. They say it’s the country’s scariest place and locals call it&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle of&nbsp;Transylvania. After the meeting, you decide to&nbsp;check out this place.</p><p>You drive to&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;the forest. You go&nbsp;into the thicket and hear the singing of&nbsp;birds, and the chirping of&nbsp;crickets. Somewhere in&nbsp;the distance, branches crackle, and some <a href=# title=animal data-link=tag>animal</a> howls. Some trees look ominous. Their branches look like many crooked arms. It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;you that someone is&nbsp;watching you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f7d/899/fb5cae5b55ac23fb1744dd0eef.jpeg><p>You take a&nbsp;few more steps and find yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small clearing. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect circle with grass, but no&nbsp;trees are growing here for some reason. You hear a&nbsp;loan from above. You look up&nbsp;and see a&nbsp;bright light between the trees. It&nbsp;gets brighter and brighter, and you lose consciousness.</p><p>You’re walking through the forest. It’s already dark. You’re cold, but fortunately, you can see the road ahead and your <a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a>. You come home, open the door and look at&nbsp;the wall clock. This is&nbsp;strange. It’s 10&nbsp;pm now. You drove to&nbsp;the forest at&nbsp;5&nbsp;pm, then took a&nbsp;little walk in&nbsp;the woods. Where did a&nbsp;few hours&nbsp;go?</p><p>Then you notice something weird. There are strange red spots on&nbsp;your left hand. Are these burns or&nbsp;some rash? You go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the mirror and see that there is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;strange rash on&nbsp;your legs, arms, and neck. You tell your new friends about&nbsp;it, but they don’t look surprised. They say that most legends about this forest are associated with time travel and memory lapses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/4c4/9a1/58ad4752d086c2be98692c239e.jpeg><p>Some say that they don’t remember how they spent several hours in&nbsp;the forest and what they did there. Others talk about a&nbsp;strange rash on&nbsp;their hands. There are legends that the ghosts of&nbsp;lost people wander there, and some flying objects often visit this place.</p><p>Someone said they had heard an&nbsp;ominous whisper in&nbsp;the forest and seen flying heads without bodies. The most famous legend says about a&nbsp;5-year-old girl who disappeared in&nbsp;the forest. Rescuers and locals searched for her in&nbsp;the woods for several weeks but found nothing.</p><p>Then, a&nbsp;few years later, the girl came out of&nbsp;the forest alive and well. But the strangest thing is&nbsp;that she hadn’t aged at&nbsp;all. She remained the same 5-year-old girl. After that, people began to&nbsp;think there was a&nbsp;time portal in&nbsp;the forest. If&nbsp;someone gets there, they will find themselves in&nbsp;the future. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;several hours or&nbsp;several years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/356/b4a/08164b5c9196ea4a6e514ff629.jpeg><p>Another myth is&nbsp;about a&nbsp;biologist who photographed the local fauna in&nbsp;the forest. He&nbsp;was taking photos of&nbsp;flowers and trees and caught on&nbsp;camera a&nbsp;strange object that flew in&nbsp;the sky. After that, people were sure that beings of&nbsp;extraterrestrial civilizations visited the forest. In&nbsp;the 15th century, a&nbsp;woman also disappeared there.</p><p>But 500 years later, she came out of&nbsp;the forest completely healthy. Of&nbsp;course, it’s unlikely that she was that woman, but a&nbsp;coin dated to&nbsp;the 1600s was found in&nbsp;her pocket. All these stories, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;reports about phantoms, are rumors and myths. No&nbsp;one has yet been able to&nbsp;prove that the forest is&nbsp;really the center of&nbsp;paranormal activity.</p><p>But if&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;visit this place, ask local farmers who live near the forest to&nbsp;share some stories with you. Perhaps they will tell you something more creepy and truthful. But this forest is&nbsp;really scary. You may feel anxious and inexplicable panic. There are many videos on&nbsp;the Internet where tourists and travelers visited this forest and talked about unpleasant excitement and strange sounds. Also, you can see something strange in&nbsp;the woods at&nbsp;any moment with your own eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/b48/fe9/8186955c738fa85fec2c48e108.jpeg><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;round clearing where, for some reason, trees don’t grow. There is&nbsp;grass and plants here. The soil here is&nbsp;the same as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the forest. Scientists took an&nbsp;analysis of&nbsp;the ground to&nbsp;check this. It’s still unknown why there are no&nbsp;trees. Some trees in&nbsp;the forest have a&nbsp;strange curved shape. It’s unclear what made them grow this way, but they look creepy.</p><p>You can take a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;the forest and check how true the legends about it&nbsp;are. But don’t be&nbsp;afraid, you won’t be&nbsp;alone. The Hoia Baciu forest is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Romania’s most popular tourist destinations. Every year thousands of&nbsp;fans of&nbsp;mystical riddles come here to&nbsp;test their nerves.</p><p>But even if&nbsp;you don’t find anything mystical in&nbsp;the forest, you will definitely enjoy the city. Externally, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful city with cozy European architecture. But go&nbsp;inside the buildings, and you’ll see modern, stylish bars and cafes. This place also attracts many&nbsp;IT specialists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a13/a5c/057baf5f5ab9f876002c1b04d2.jpeg><p>You’ve probably heard of&nbsp;forests where some guy decorated all the trees with sinister dolls. But all this will seem like fun toys compared to&nbsp;what one guy found in&nbsp;County Park in&nbsp;Huntington, <a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a>. He&nbsp;was walking in&nbsp;the forest and came to&nbsp;a&nbsp;small clearing.</p><p>There, many trees had attached photos with images of&nbsp;people who were missing. Just a&nbsp;person’s face with his name, date, and place of&nbsp;disappearance. The guy recorded this place on&nbsp;video and posted it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Internet. The video became popular on&nbsp;Reddit. Its users discovered that all these people from photos went missing in&nbsp;different states.</p><p>None of&nbsp;them were found alive. After such a&nbsp;terrible walk, the guy called the police. Soon, they found out that one local hung these photos on&nbsp;trees during a&nbsp;Halloween party. At&nbsp;the request of&nbsp;the police, he&nbsp;removed all the pictures. The case was closed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/372/a9c/3db8f15b0183fb296eea0a0998.jpeg><p>Imagine you’ve lost in&nbsp;the woods. You’ve been walking in&nbsp;the forest for several hours. You tie your scarf to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tree branch and walk further along the narrow path. Half an&nbsp;hour later, you come to&nbsp;the tree with the scarf. You’ve never turned left or&nbsp;right, but why are you walking in&nbsp;circles, then?</p><p>The answer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;round forest. There’s nothing mystical here, but it&nbsp;still attracts the attention of&nbsp;many tourists. The forest grows in&nbsp;the south of&nbsp;Japan. If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;from a&nbsp;bird’s-eye view, you will see that trees grow in&nbsp;a&nbsp;circle, forming several layers. The closer to&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;this circle, the closer the trees are placed to&nbsp;each other.</p><p>It&nbsp;resembles mysterious circular patterns in&nbsp;fields worldwide, but there’s nothing fantastic here. No&nbsp;spaceships from another planet and no&nbsp;natural anomaly made this, but people. In&nbsp;1973, people planted trees in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;10&nbsp;concentric circles. It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;experiment that showed how cedars would grow in&nbsp;such unusual conditions. The trees began to&nbsp;grow in&nbsp;a&nbsp;convex shape, symmetrically fanning out.</p><p>This proved that the size of&nbsp;the gaps between the trees affects their growth. Initially, according to&nbsp;the plan, people had to&nbsp;cut down trees. But the place became popular among tourists. Its photo quickly spread throughout the Internet, so&nbsp;people decided to&nbsp;leave it&nbsp;untouched. You can also visit this forest and take beautiful drone shots.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2mu8%2BlnGagkauybrnEpqarsV2hrrG%2FxKxkmp6kmr9uwsisoK2hnpx6tbTIrGSfp6KawLV5l2ptam9mZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpeople-have-memory-lapses-after-visiting-this-forest-816176.html&text=People%20Have%20Memory%20Lapses%20After%20Visiting%20This%20Forest&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeople-have-memory-lapses-after-visiting-this-forest-816176.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeople-have-memory-lapses-after-visiting-this-forest-816176.html&title=People%20Have%20Memory%20Lapses%20After%20Visiting%20This%20Forest" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpeople-have-memory-lapses-after-visiting-this-forest-816176.html&title=People%20Have%20Memory%20Lapses%20After%20Visiting%20This%20Forest" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpeople-have-memory-lapses-after-visiting-this-forest-816176.html&title=People%20Have%20Memory%20Lapses%20After%20Visiting%20This%20Forest" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeople-have-memory-lapses-after-visiting-this-forest-816176.html&description=People%20Have%20Memory%20Lapses%20After%20Visiting%20This%20Forest" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lyon-turin-un-projet-lance-mais-pas-encore-finance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="un projet lanc, mais pas encore financ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-darien-sills-evans-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Darien Sills-Evans Make?
