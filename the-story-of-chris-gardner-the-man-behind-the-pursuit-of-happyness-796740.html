The film is&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;the true story of&nbsp;Christopher Gardner, a&nbsp;man who has faced many obstacles in&nbsp;life to&nbsp;achieve happiness, even being forced to&nbsp;sleep on&nbsp;the streets with his son.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>wants to&nbsp;share with you the story of&nbsp;Chris, going beyond the events narrated in&nbsp;the film. Let’s have a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;his <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>, his path to&nbsp;success, and what his life looks like today.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;tough childhood</h2></p><p>Christopher Paul Gardner was born on&nbsp;February&nbsp;9, 1954, in&nbsp;Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His childhood was far from being a&nbsp;fairy tale; he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;absent father, and his mother, Bettye Jean, married a&nbsp;man named Freddie Triplett, <strong>someone who would deeply mark Chris’s life</strong>.</p><p>Triplett was <a href=#>abusive</a> to&nbsp;his wife and children. He&nbsp;even reported Chris’s mother to&nbsp;the authorities and had her sent to&nbsp;prison for working while receiving help from Social Services. During that time, Chris and his 3&nbsp;sisters had to&nbsp;temporarily live in&nbsp;foster homes. Months later, Bettye was released, but she would go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;jail again. Drowned in&nbsp;despair, she even tried to&nbsp;set Triplett’s house on&nbsp;fire with him inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a36/70e/bbc0ee517cb2617750f045379c.jpg><p>But out of&nbsp;all that suffering, one day would remain in&nbsp;Chris’s <a href=#>memory</a> forever. It&nbsp;was Christmas and he&nbsp;was 16&nbsp;years old. He&nbsp;was taking a&nbsp;bath when his stepfather suddenly broke into the bathroom with a&nbsp;shotgun and kicked him out of&nbsp;the house, leaving him on&nbsp;the street, wet and naked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold night.</p><p>After having lived through these sad experiences, Chris was clear about something: he&nbsp;would not become his stepfather. He&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;take his mother as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;strength instead.</p><p>“I&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;embrace the spirit of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom—who despite the fact that she had too many of&nbsp;her own dreams denied, deferred, and destroyed—still instilled in&nbsp;me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I could have dreams,” he&nbsp;confessed.</p><p><h2>Marriage and fatherhood</h2></p><p>Chris left Wisconsin when he&nbsp;entered the US&nbsp;Navy and joined the Medical Corps. There he&nbsp;met Dr. Robert Ellis, who offered him a&nbsp;<a href=#>job</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;research assistant at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;California Medical Center. It&nbsp;was 1974 when he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;San Francisco.</p><p>Chris’ future seemed to&nbsp;brighten. In&nbsp;1977, he&nbsp;married Sherry Dyson and was planning on&nbsp;going to&nbsp;Medical School, but then realized the time and money he&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;invest were beyond him, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;changed his mind. This damaged his already fractured relationship with his then-wife.</p><p>Sometime later, Chris met a&nbsp;woman named Jackie Medina, who got pregnant. This was when Chris separated from his wife to&nbsp;care of&nbsp;Jackie and their son. At&nbsp;the time <a href=#>his son was born</a>, he&nbsp;was working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;research lab assistant, but as&nbsp;his salary wasn’t enough, he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;sales representative for a&nbsp;medical equipment company, but without luxury.</p><p><h2>Signs in&nbsp;life travel in&nbsp;Ferraris.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/eeb/d3b/cb705358528cbeddc55bdff6f3.png><p>Once he&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;well-dressed man get out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;red Ferrari on&nbsp;the street. That day, his life changed. Impressed, Chris asked, “What do&nbsp;you&nbsp;do, and how do&nbsp;you do&nbsp;it?” The <a href=#>man</a> was Bob Bridges, a&nbsp;stockbroker who made about <a href=#>$80,000&nbsp;a month</a>.</p><p>Driven by&nbsp;the possibility of&nbsp;achieving his long-awaited success, Chris canceled his sales meetings and postponed paying his parking tickets until he&nbsp;was accepted into the training program at&nbsp;another company. Then he&nbsp;quit his old job. But as&nbsp;bad luck would have&nbsp;it, when he&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the office on&nbsp;his first day of&nbsp;work, he&nbsp;found out that the person who had hired him had been fired.</p><p>With a&nbsp;young son and a&nbsp;deteriorating relationship, Chris was forced to&nbsp;look elsewhere for a&nbsp;new chance and got an&nbsp;interview at&nbsp;Dean Witter Reynolds to&nbsp;<strong>train as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stockbroker</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/26d/285/ab0b015c21beb267319fea093e.jpg><p>But, once again, luck was not on&nbsp;his side, and, a&nbsp;little over a&nbsp;week before his job interview, he&nbsp;was arrested for $1,200&nbsp;he had accumulated in&nbsp;fines. He&nbsp;spent 10&nbsp;days in&nbsp;prison, and when he&nbsp;got out of&nbsp;jail, he&nbsp;realized Jackie had left, taking their son and all of&nbsp;his belongings. A&nbsp;day after his release, Chris had to&nbsp;attend his interview in&nbsp;the same clothes he&nbsp;had used during his time in&nbsp;prison: casual pants, sneakers, and a&nbsp;jacket. Despite that, he&nbsp;was accepted into the internship program. He&nbsp;would receive a&nbsp;salary of&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;a month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d4c/481/58b04553dcb475e64ba9b7a36f.jpg><p>4&nbsp;months later, Jackie returned with little Christopher, and both parents decided that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;better if&nbsp;he&nbsp;stayed with his father. There was only one small problem, <strong>the boarding house where Chris lived didn’t accept children</strong>, and he&nbsp;didn’t have enough money to&nbsp;pay rent. It&nbsp;was then that a&nbsp;pilgrimage began for father and son.</p><p>Chris’s salary was barely enough for diapers, food, and childcare, so&nbsp;when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;choose whether the money was spent on&nbsp;food or&nbsp;shelter, the decision was always food. <strong>Chris and his little boy spent the night wherever they could</strong>; Cheap motels, hostels, parks, under a&nbsp;desk at&nbsp;Chris’ office, and even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;public bathroom at&nbsp;a&nbsp;subway station in&nbsp;Oakland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/276/23a/a481d45066a1922039eb581886.png><p>Chris and his son went from one “home” to&nbsp;another for about a&nbsp;year. In&nbsp;the meantime, he&nbsp;continued his internship in&nbsp;finance and never told his colleagues that he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;place to&nbsp;live. Instead, he&nbsp;received help from people he&nbsp;didn’t expect, like Rev. Cecil Williams from Glide Memorial Church. He&nbsp;gave Chris a&nbsp;room despite the fact that it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;program that was only for single mothers. In&nbsp;fact, even some “ladies of&nbsp;the evening” (as&nbsp;Chris himself <a href=#>calls</a> them) started giving him $5&nbsp;bills regularly, when they saw him with his baby in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rickety stroller.</p><p>To&nbsp;earn a&nbsp;few extra bucks, <a href=#>Chris</a> took some random jobs. He&nbsp;mowed lawns, tidied gardens, built roofs, cleaned basements, and even sold his blood, although he&nbsp;was never very proud of&nbsp;the latter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/40b/f7c/0ad3a8568a9cf789a062d982fe.jpg><p><h2>I&nbsp;call this moment in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life “happiness.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a8a/03d/0bcacd57dbb52bfb064eeb2654.png><p>After going through considerably tough times and standing out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dedicated and <a href=# title=persevering data-link=tag>persevering</a> intern, Chris took the exam to&nbsp;obtain his license as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stockbroker in&nbsp;1982. He&nbsp;passed and <strong>managed to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;stable job </strong>with a&nbsp;much better salary. Now he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;pay rent.</p><p><a href=#>Chris</a> had gone from being an&nbsp;apprentice with nowhere to&nbsp;sleep to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;respected stockbroker. He&nbsp;was even offered a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;Wall Street in&nbsp;New York and lived in&nbsp;that city for 2&nbsp;years before moving to&nbsp;Chicago and starting Gardner Rich &&nbsp;Co., his own company with an&nbsp;initial investment of&nbsp;$10,000 in&nbsp;1987.</p><p>A&nbsp;year later, he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;earn over <a href=#>a&nbsp;million dollars</a>. Lack of&nbsp;money was no&nbsp;longer a&nbsp;problem for him. Excited about his achievements, <strong>he&nbsp;bought his own Ferrari</strong>, but not just anyone, he&nbsp;bought one that had formerly belonged to&nbsp;basketball player Michael Jordan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a9/b56/96b27c5b49921a4b6cbc176429.jpg><p>By&nbsp;2006, Chris had managed to&nbsp;grow his company immensely and sold it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;multi-million dollar deal. He&nbsp;later became the founder of&nbsp;Christopher Gardner International Holdings and placed offices in&nbsp;New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. Through&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;contributes to&nbsp;various philanthropic organizations related to&nbsp;education, access to&nbsp;housing, and job creation projects.</p><p>Chris is&nbsp;currently a&nbsp;successful <a href=#>lecturer</a> who travels the world motivating people to&nbsp;pursue their dreams and explaining topics related to&nbsp;business success. This is&nbsp;very fulfilling for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c44/03a/1163065ef89f6ba357c96636d8.jpg><p><h2>Chris’s life in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be2/204/952d145515aacf5d27b842b9ee.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you’ve already watched the movie The Pursuit of&nbsp;Happyness, you may have noticed some differences from the story you just read.
