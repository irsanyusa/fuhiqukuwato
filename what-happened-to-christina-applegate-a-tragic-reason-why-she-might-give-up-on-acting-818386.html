As&nbsp;her condition progressed, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>experienced</a> worsening symptoms, such as&nbsp;numbness and tingling in&nbsp;her extremities, compelling her to&nbsp;undergo further medical evaluation.</p><p>The impact of&nbsp;Applegate’s diagnosis reverberated beyond her personal life, briefly halting production on&nbsp;<i>Dead to&nbsp;Me</i> to&nbsp;address her health concerns. This hiatus provided her with invaluable time for self-reflection and processing, allowing her to&nbsp;navigate the emotional complexities of&nbsp;her diagnosis.</p><p>Throughout her journey, Applegate has displayed resilience and determination, refusing to&nbsp;succumb to&nbsp;despair.

Embracing her authentic self, she celebrated the occasion barefoot, symbolizing her resilience and unwavering spirit.</p><p>During her speech at&nbsp;the ceremony, Applegate humorously addressed her barefoot appearance, playfully revealing her&nbsp;MS diagnosis to&nbsp;the audience. With a&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;levity, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarked</a>, «Oh, by&nbsp;the way, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;disease. Did you not notice? I’m not even wearing shoes.

These challenges have made her work on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<i>Dead to&nbsp;Me</i> increasingly difficult. She struggled with prolonged periods of&nbsp;heat, navigating stairs, and even had to&nbsp;resort to&nbsp;using a&nbsp;wheelchair to&nbsp;reach the set.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;candid interview with May 2023, Applegate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> the profound impact of&nbsp;MS on&nbsp;her acting career. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hinted</a> that her role in&nbsp;<i>Dead to&nbsp;Me</i> might be&nbsp;her last on-camera appearance, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of&nbsp;living with MS.</p><p>Describing her daily struggles, Applegate highlighted the constant fear of&nbsp;accidents, such as&nbsp;slipping in&nbsp;the shower, due to&nbsp;MS-related symptoms like leg weakness. «You can fall, you can slip, your legs can buckle,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. «Especially because&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;glass shower. It’s frightening to&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;there. There are just certain things that people take for granted in&nbsp;their lives that&nbsp;I took for granted. Going down the stairs, carrying things, you can’t do&nbsp;that anymore.»</p><p>Moreover, her heightened susceptibility to&nbsp;infections due to&nbsp;MS prompts her to&nbsp;avoid crowded environments, further complicating her daily life.</p><p><h2>She received an&nbsp;emotional standing ovation at&nbsp;the Emmys for her rare appearance after her diagnosis.</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;the 2024 Emmy Awards, Christina Applegate played dual roles as&nbsp;both a&nbsp;presenter and a&nbsp;nominee. As&nbsp;she gracefully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took</a> the stage with a&nbsp;cane and alongside fellow actor Anthony Anderson, the audience rose to&nbsp;their feet in&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartfelt standing ovation, acknowledging her resilience.</p><p>In&nbsp;her speech, Applegate candidly referred to&nbsp;her&nbsp;MS diagnosis, infusing humor into the moment by&nbsp;joking about the audience with their standing ovation, «You’re totally shaming me&nbsp;with disability by&nbsp;standing&nbsp;up,» she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>joked</a>. «It’s fine.» Despite her emotional vulnerability, she continued to&nbsp;lighten the atmosphere with witty remarks, suggesting that the applause need not accompany every moment.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;the experience during an&nbsp;interview on&nbsp;Good Morning America in&nbsp;March, Applegate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> to&nbsp;feeling overwhelmed, even experiencing a&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;disorientation. «People said, ‘Oh, you were so&nbsp;funny,’ and I’m like, ‘I don’t even know what I&nbsp;said. I&nbsp;don’t know what&nbsp;I was doing. I&nbsp;got so&nbsp;freaked out that&nbsp;I didn’t even know what was happening anymore.’»</p><p>Despite this, she expressed gratitude for the overwhelming love and support she felt from the audience.</p><p><h2>She decided to&nbsp;launch a&nbsp;podcast with her friend who has the same diagnosis.</h2></p><p>Christina Applegate initiated a&nbsp;podcast venture, delving into her journey with MS.

The podcast, described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;platform for self-reflection, growth, and laughter, features candid conversations between the hosts, along with discussions with friends, co-stars, and individuals integral to&nbsp;navigating life’s complexities.</p><p>Their connection was sparked by&nbsp;a&nbsp;mutual friend, Lance Bass, and their subsequent conversations led to&nbsp;the inception of&nbsp;the podcast.
